//!
//! Hello, I am xTekC.
//!
//! As an open source developer, I have a passion for creating software that is efficient, elegant, and secure. My experience with Rust, Bash, and C, along with my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, has allowed me to contribute to a variety of open source projects and create innovative solutions for complex problems.
//!
//! In addition to my technical skills, I have also proven myself as a strong leader and team player. As a team lead for over 30 associates, I have implemented initiatives that have improved departments' productivity, reduced material costs, and enhanced the safety and well-being of associates within the company.
//!
//! My interest in programming and security has driven me to explore ways to create security programs that protect the privacy and security of users and systems. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and make a positive impact on the organization I am a part of.
//!
//! Aside from my work experience, I am also interested in content creation and am currently working on creating video content for YouTube and writing for blogs. I am also interested in participating in a podcast to discuss educational topics and am currently learning the German language.
